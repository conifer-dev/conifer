Hi! I'm Conifer or Krystian as my real name goes and welcome to my site! I'm an inspiring indie game developer who recently embarked on a journey to learn programming to one day catch up to my childhood dream of working in a game development studio or instead to create my little games.

Learning programming has been the most challenging part of my life. Coming from zero computer science background and low-income family, I never had the luxury to study CS in a university. Self-studying Computer Science and programming overall taught me more than I could ever imagine, and I can't wait to see what awaits me further down the road!

I'm a massive fan of Go programming language. I've found it an absolute blast to learn & use in any project, and I'm hoping to use Golang in my future projects and journey as I Go (pun intended).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/con_ifer) most of the time. You can also visit my [Itch.io Page](https://conifer-dev.itch.io) to see my current work.
