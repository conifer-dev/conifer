## Life*

**A** game that never seen its finalised production back in 2013 aimed to be created using the Ren'Py engine. It was a visual novel game that showed the difficulties teenagers went through in their teenage life stages. Battling depression, family breaking apart and the inevitable bullying that took place in school, but lastly of love and how having just one person in your life can make a difference. To show that no matter what is going through your life, you're never alone.

The story aim was to portrait the good parts of life, but also the bad. Our protagonist is Tachibana Taichi, a 15 years old teenage boy. An ordinary freshly enrolled high school student of class 1-F. He has short brown hair with his bangs placed in the left side. He as well wears glasses due to his weak eyesight.

His life progresses further the game as his family breaks down due divorce of his parents which causes character progression that drops him down to the spiral of depression.  As the story unfolds, our protagonist's life will continue breaking down to contemplating suicide after his father's continuous abuse. However, our protagonist will have a chance to meet Chie, Takahashi Chie, a classmate of 1-F that Taichi belongs to.

Chie is a 15 years old teenage girl, freshly enrolled high school student of class 1-F. She has medium-sized black hair with light brown eye colour. She as well wears glasses due to weak eyesight.
 
Chie is a small girl despite her age which causes her being bullied by a group of girls from class 1-F. She's a shy and socially awkward girl who is another weakness that the bullies pick on. However, she is a beautiful girl with a gorgeous smile which is very rarely seen. She has a slender body and comes tidily to school in her uniform.

Our second protagonist grew up in a low-income family which is the main reason behind her being an unfortunate victim of bullying at school.

By nature, she is a kind and lovely girl who loves animal, and in future, she wants to be a veterinarian.
