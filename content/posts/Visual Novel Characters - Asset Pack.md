## Introduction to VN Character Asset Pack

A large folder of art that totals 176 files of art for a Visual Novel Game was just released on my [itch.io](https://conifer-dev.itch.io/visual-novel-characters-asset-pack) page.

As the game I worked on back in 2013 never seen it's light and the art continued to rot on my cloud storage, I thought it would be for the best that I release it to public under [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)
