## VN Character Asset Pack

![](https://i.postimg.cc/bYTkvgFg/vnassets-webpage.png#center)

A large folder of art that totals around 176 files for a Visual Novel styled game was just released on my [itch.io](https://conifer-dev.itch.io/visual-novel-characters-asset-pack) page.

As the game, I worked on back in 2013 never seen it's light. The art continued to rot on my cloud storage. I thought it would be best to release it to the public under [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) and allow new game designers/developers use the art to create something of their own and let the characters that I became attached to have a new life!

**In total, there are ten characters with multiple poses.**

**Once again, you can download the asset pack from my **[**itch.io**](https://conifer-dev.itch.io/visual-novel-characters-asset-pack)** page.**

Please get in touch if you ever create anything with the asset pack! I would love to see the characters live and shine once again.
